# C - More malloc, free

## Overview
This project is a continuation of the previous malloc and free project, diving deeper into dynamic memory allocation in C. It's designed for master-level programmers to further their understanding of memory management techniques.

## Author
- **Julien Barbier**

## Implementer
- **Xavier J. Cruz**

## Key Concepts
1. **Advanced Memory Allocation**: Further exploration of dynamic memory allocation techniques.
2. **Exit Function**: Understanding and using the exit function.
3. **Calloc and Realloc**: Learning about these standard library functions and their usage.

## Requirements
- Use allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Follow Betty style guidelines
- No use of global variables
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Only allowed C standard library functions are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`
- You can use `_putchar`
- Include function prototypes in `main.h`

## Resources
The project provides resources on casting the result of malloc, and man pages for exit, calloc, and realloc. It's crucial to review these materials thoroughly before starting the tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- How to use the exit function
- What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them

## Tasks
1. Write a function that allocates memory using malloc
2. Write a function that concatenates two strings
3. Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc
4. Write a function that creates an array of integers

This project aims to deepen your understanding of memory management in C, building upon the basics learned in the previous malloc project. It challenges you to handle more complex memory allocation scenarios, improving your overall C programming skills.
