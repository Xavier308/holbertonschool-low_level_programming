# Holberton School - Low Level Programming

## Implemented by
Xavier J. Cruz (based on content by HBTN)

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to various projects and tasks related to low-level programming in C. These projects cover fundamental concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, pointers, memory management, file I/O, and more.

## Projects
- **argc_argv**: Covers the use of argc and argv in C programs.
- **bit_manipulation**: Provides solutions involving bit manipulation.
- **doubly_linked_lists**: Implements operations on doubly linked lists.
- **file_io**: Focuses on file input/output and error handling.
- **function_pointers**: Demonstrates the use of function pointers in C.
- **functions_nested_loops**: Contains functions and nested loops examples.
- **hello_world**: Basic "Hello, World!" program.
- **malloc_free**: Covers dynamic memory allocation and freeing memory.
- **more_functions_nested_loops**: Additional functions and nested loops examples.
- **more_malloc_free**: Further exploration of malloc and free functions.
- **pointers_arrays_strings**: Covers pointers, arrays, and strings in C.
- **recursion**: Contains recursive functions examples.
- **singly_linked_lists**: Implements operations on singly linked lists.
- **structures_typedef**: Covers structures and typedef in C.
- **variables_if_else_while**: Includes solutions involving variables, if-else statements, and while loops.
- **variadic_functions**: Demonstrates the use of variadic functions in C.

## Getting Started
Each project contains its own set of tasks and instructions. You can navigate to each project directory to view the specific README and task files for more information.

## Requirements
- All code is written in C programming language.
- Code is compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with specific compiler flags mentioned in each project's README.
- Files adhere to the Betty coding style guidelines.
- There should be no errors or warnings during compilation.
