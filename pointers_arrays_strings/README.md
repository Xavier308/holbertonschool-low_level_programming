# C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Overview
This project focuses on the fundamental concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. It's designed for amateur programmers to deepen their understanding of these crucial topics.

## Author
- **Julien Barbier**

## Implementer
- **Xavier J. Cruz**

## Key Concepts
1. **Pointers**: Understanding and using pointers in C.
2. **Arrays**: Working with arrays and their applications.
3. **Strings**: Manipulating and using strings in C.
4. **Memory Layout**: Understanding how memory is organized in C programs.

## Requirements
- Use allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Follow Betty style guidelines
- No use of global variables
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Standard library functions like `printf` and `puts` are forbidden
- You can use `_putchar`
- Include function prototypes in `main.h`

## Resources
The project provides resources on C arrays, pointers, strings, and memory layout. It's crucial to review these materials thoroughly before starting the tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What pointers are and how to use them
- What arrays are and how to use them
- The differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and manipulate them
- The scope of variables in C

## Additional Notes
- This project does not cover pointers to functions, pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, arrays of structures, or dynamic memory allocation (`malloc` and `free`).

This project aims to build a solid foundation in handling data structures in C, focusing on the manipulation of memory addresses and sequential data storage. It's a crucial step in advancing your C programming skills.
