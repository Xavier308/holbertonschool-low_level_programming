# C - Functions, nested loops

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding and implementing functions and nested loops in C programming. It's designed for novice programmers and is part of a larger C programming curriculum.

## Key Concepts
1. **Nested Loops**: Understanding how to use loops within loops.
2. **Functions**: Learning about function declaration, definition, and usage.
3. **Function Prototypes**: Understanding their purpose and how to use them.
4. **Variable Scope**: Exploring the scope of variables in C.
5. **Header Files**: Learning how to use header files with `#include`.

## Requirements
- Use allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Follow Betty style guidelines
- No use of global variables
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Standard library functions like `printf` and `puts` are forbidden
- You can use `_putchar`
- Include function prototypes in `main.h`

## Resources
The project provides various resources including articles on nested while loops, C functions, and header files. It's recommended to review these materials before starting the tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- The concept and usage of nested loops
- How to define and use functions
- The difference between function declaration and definition
- The purpose of function prototypes
- Variable scope in C
- Usage of gcc flags
- How to use header files with `#include`

This project aims to deepen your understanding of fundamental C programming concepts, with a focus on functions and control structures.
