## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What are function pointers and how to use them
- What does a function pointer exactly hold

- Code should use the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only allowed C standard library functions: malloc, free, exit
- Allowed to use _putchar
- Don't push _putchar.c
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `function_pointers.h`
- All header files should be include guarded
