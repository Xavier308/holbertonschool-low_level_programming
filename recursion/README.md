# C - Recursion

## Overview
This project focuses on the concept of recursion in C programming. It's designed for amateur programmers to understand and implement recursive solutions to problems.

## Author
- **Julien Barbier**

## Implementer
- **Xavier J. Cruz**

## Key Concepts
1. **Recursion**: Understanding the concept of a function calling itself.
2. **Recursive Implementation**: Learning how to write recursive functions.
3. **Appropriate Use**: Identifying situations where recursion is beneficial.
4. **Limitations**: Understanding when not to use recursion.

## Requirements
- Use allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Follow Betty style guidelines
- No use of global variables
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Standard library functions like `printf` and `puts` are forbidden
- You can use `_putchar`
- Include function prototypes in `main.h`
- **No loops allowed**
- No use of static variables

## Resources
The project provides various resources including introductions to recursion, C-specific recursion tutorials, and video tutorials. It's crucial to review these materials thoroughly before starting the tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What recursion is
- How to implement recursion
- In what situations you should implement recursion
- In what situations you shouldn't implement recursion

## Additional Notes
- This project emphasizes the use of recursion and prohibits the use of loops, encouraging a deep understanding of recursive problem-solving.
- The restriction on static variables promotes clean recursive implementations.

This project aims to develop your skills in recursive thinking and implementation, a crucial concept in computer science and programming. It challenges you to solve problems using recursive approaches, enhancing your problem-solving abilities in C programming.
