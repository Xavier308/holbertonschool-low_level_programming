# C - argc, argv

## Overview
This project focuses on handling command-line arguments in C programming using `argc` and `argv`. It's designed for amateur programmers to understand and implement programs that can accept and process command-line inputs.

## Author
- **Julien Barbier**

## Implementer
- **Xavier J. Cruz**

## Key Concepts
1. **Command-line Arguments**: Understanding how to use arguments passed to your program.
2. **Main Function Prototypes**: Learning different prototypes of the main function.
3. **Unused Variables**: How to handle unused variables or parameters in functions.

## Requirements
- Use allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Follow Betty style guidelines
- No use of global variables
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Include function prototypes in `main.h`
- You are allowed to use the standard library

## Resources
The project provides resources on arguments to main, `argc` and `argv`, their meanings, and how to compile with unused variables. It's crucial to review these materials thoroughly before starting the tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- How to use arguments passed to your program
- Two prototypes of `main` and when to use each
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Tasks
1. Write a program that prints its name
2. Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it
3. Write a program that prints all arguments it receives
4. Write a program that multiplies two numbers
5. Write a program that adds positive numbers

This project aims to enhance your understanding of how C programs interact with the command line, a crucial skill for creating more flexible and user-friendly programs. It challenges you to process various types of inputs and handle different scenarios, improving your overall C programming skills.
