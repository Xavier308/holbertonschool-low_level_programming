# C - More functions, more nested loops

## Overview
This project is a continuation of the previous "Functions, nested loops" project, delving deeper into C programming concepts. It's designed for novice programmers to further their understanding of functions and control structures.

## Key Concepts
1. **Advanced Nested Loops**: Further exploration of complex loop structures.
2. **Function Mastery**: Deeper dive into function creation and usage.
3. **Function Prototypes**: Reinforcing understanding of prototypes and their importance.
4. **Variable Scope**: Expanding knowledge on variable scope in different contexts.
5. **Header File Usage**: Advanced techniques for using header files.

## Requirements
- Use allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Follow Betty style guidelines
- No use of global variables
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Standard library functions like `printf` and `puts` are forbidden
- You can use `_putchar`
- Include function prototypes in `main.h`

## Resources
The project provides resources similar to the previous one, including materials on nested while loops, C functions, and header files. It's recommended to review these materials, especially focusing on more advanced concepts.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain in depth:
- Advanced usage of nested loops
- Complex function definitions and declarations
- Detailed understanding of function prototypes
- Comprehensive knowledge of variable scope in different scenarios
- Proficient use of gcc flags
- Advanced techniques for using header files with `#include`

This project aims to solidify your understanding of C programming concepts, with a particular focus on more complex functions and nested loop structures. It builds upon the foundation laid in the previous project, challenging you to apply these concepts in more sophisticated ways.
