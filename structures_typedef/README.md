# C - Structures, typedef

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding and implementing structures and typedef in C programming. It's designed for master-level programmers to deepen their knowledge of these fundamental concepts.

## Author
- **Julien Barbier**

## Implementer
- **Xavier J. Cruz**

## Key Concepts
1. **Structures**: Understanding what structures are, when and why to use them, and how to implement them.
2. **Typedef**: Learning how to use typedef to create aliases for data types.

## Requirements
- Use allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Follow Betty style guidelines
- No use of global variables
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Only allowed C standard library functions are `printf`, `malloc`, `free` and `exit`
- Include guards for all header files

## Resources
The project provides various resources including PDFs on structures and typedef, documentation on structures, and a chapter from "Programming in C" by Stephen Kochan. There's also an advanced, optional reading on C structure packing.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What structures are, when, why and how to use them
- How to use typedef

## Additional Notes
- This project emphasizes the practical application of structures and typedef in C programming.
- The restrictions on library functions encourage a deeper understanding of memory management and program structure.

This project aims to enhance your ability to organize and manipulate data in C, providing you with powerful tools for creating more complex and efficient programs. It builds upon fundamental C concepts, challenging you to think about data organization and type definition in more sophisticated ways.
