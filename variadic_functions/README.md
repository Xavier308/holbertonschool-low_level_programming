## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing variadic functions in C programming. It covers various tasks that demonstrate the usage of variadic functions and related concepts.

## Author

* **Julien Barbier** - *Project creator*

## Implementation

* **Xavier J. Cruz** - *Project implementation*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What are variadic functions
- How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
- Why and how to use the const type qualifier

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should use the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only allowed C standard library functions: malloc, free, exit
- Allowed to use the following macros: va_start, va_arg and va_end
- Allowed to use _putchar
- Don't push _putchar.c
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `variadic_functions.h`
- All header files should be include guarded
